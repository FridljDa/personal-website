              * Analyzed the role of air pollution in the race-ethnicity to premature mortality causal chain, under [Pascal Geldsetzer](https://profiles.stanford.edu/pascal-geldsetzer)'s guidance, leading to key insights that contribute to policy-shaping discussions.
              * Spearheaded the project with minimal supervision. 
              * Devised and [implemented](https://github.com/FridljDa/pm25_inequality) a comprehensive statistical analysis in R, synthesized findings from 150 pertinent publications, wrote the initial manuscript and technical supplement, and drove the manuscript from conceptualization to successful publication.
              * Harmonized geospatial and tabular data on air pollution, mortality, population numbers, and orchestrated analyses of 10 different steps. 
              * Executed major revisions of the manuscript and conducted new analyses, including 15 new figures, within a strict 2-month deadline as part of the 'Revise and Resubmit' response.
              * Developed an interactive [Shiny web application](https://github.com/FridljDa/ui_pm_attributable) to visualize 17-dimensional data, enhancing collaboration and data interpretation among the research team.
              * Collaborated with seven Stanford co-authors to systematically gather and integrate critical feedback throughout various project stages, driving a significant enhancement in research quality.

              * Developed and implemented a novel statistical method in R under the guidance of [Wolfgang Huber](https://www.huber.embl.de/) and [Nikos Ignatiadis](https://nignatiadis.github.io/) to identify outliers in large-scale data sets, enhancing detection capabilities in the presence of high-dimensional side-information.
              * Tripled statistical detection power in a high-dimensional setting by integrating Selective Inference, Machine Learning, and Empirical Bayes approaches.
              * Successfully applied the developed method to genome-wide association study, identifying key genetic markers linked to diseases.
              * Presented research findings at seven scientific events, including a seminar talks at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/) and [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/) and a competitively selected oral contribution at [DAGStat 2022](https://www.dagstat2022.uni-hamburg.de/bilder/booklet.pdf), attended by 100 scholars.
              * Conducted the peer review for manuscript at Bioinformatics Advances, contributed the peer review for manuscript at Cell Biology.
